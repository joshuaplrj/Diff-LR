Let me just take you on a Journey 🚀 on how I came up with this idea of dynamic_learninig_rate.  
Don't worry if you do not know the basics 😅 cause I have been there and I know how it feels therefore I have provided definitions 📚  
and necessary explanations to ensure that even beginers understand this.

Here it begins. ✨

# 1.
## **What is Overfitting?** 🤔
**Overfitting** occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing not just the right aspects of the data but 
also noise and random fluctuations instead of the underlying pattern. As a result, the model performs well on the training 
set but poorly on new, unseen data because it fails to generalize. 😵‍💫

## **What is Underfitting?** 😓
**Underfitting** occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the training data. As a result, the 
model performs poorly on both the training set and unseen data because it fails to learn the essential relationships.  
Underfitting also happens when the model is not trained long enough for it to fully learn the data patterns. ⏳

**In concise terms** 📌  
If the loss on the test data (L_test) is greater and the loss on the train data (L_train) is lesser then it is overfitting. 📈📉

if L_test = L_train and L_test, L_train is less that is close to 0 (lower loss) then it is optimal. ✅

if both are close to 1 (high loss) then it is underfitting. ❌

# 2.
## **Effect of learning rate in fitting** ⚙️
The learning rate (η) controls how large a step the optimizer takes when updating model parameters. Its magnitude
influences how quickly the model fits the training data and how well it generalizes.  
Therefore if the learning rate is,

- **Very high** (e.g., > 0.1 for most models) 🚀  
    - The optimizer makes large jumps and often overshoots minima.  
    - **Risk:** Underfitting – the optimizer bounces around the loss surface, never settling into a good minimum, leading to high training loss. 😵

- **Moderate** (e.g., 0.001 – 0.01 for deep nets) 🎯  
    - The optimizer makes steady, controlled updates.  
    - **Result:** Balanced – the model can converge to a good minimum, achieving low training loss while still generalizing. 😊

- **Very low** (e.g., < 1e‑5) 🐌  
    - Updates are tiny; training proceeds slowly.  
    - **Risk:** Underfitting – the model may not reach a low‑loss region within a reasonable number of epochs, resulting in high training loss. 😴

- **High early, then decayed** (learning‑rate schedule) 📉  
    - Starts with larger steps to quickly find a good region, then reduces to fine‑tune.  
    - **Benefit:** Helps avoid overfitting by allowing the model to settle into a smoother minimum and reducing the chance of over‑fitting. 🧘‍♂️

**Note** 📝: The learning rate influences how the model learns and can contribute to these issues but it's not the sole factor determining overfitting
or underfitting. Adjusting it can help manage the training process, though.

## **The Idea** 💡
The ultimate goal is to find the correct learning rate to better improve the efficiency in the training of the Model. How do we do this?  
So we can control the model to overshoot or undershoot by adjusting the learning rate. 🤹‍♂️

Okay we can also determine whether a model is overshooting and undershooting, let's call this high and low respectively.  
If we could somehow use this idea for a dynamic learning rate  
**Does this not ring something?, Yes it does binary search** 🔔

### **How Binary Search Works Step by Step** 🔍
Imagine you have a sorted array of numbers, say 📊, and you're looking for 7.

1. Initialize pointers: Set two pointers—low at the start of the array (index 0) and high at the end (last index). 👆👇

2. Find the middle: Calculate the middle index as mid = (low + high) / 2 (use integer division to avoid fractions). 🧮

3. Compare the middle element:

  - If the middle element equals the target, you've found it! Return the index. 🎉

  - If the middle element is less than the target, the target must be in the right half—set low = mid + 1. ➡️

  - If the middle element is greater than the target, the target must be in the left half—set high = mid - 1. ⬅️

4. Repeat: Continue steps 2-3 until low > high (meaning the target isn't in the array) or you find the target.  
if :  
  Handle not found: If the loop ends without finding it, return a indicator like -1. ❗

So you see we can repurpose this into finding the **optimal learning rate**. 🎯  
In standard ML practice, this aligns with techniques like the **"learning rate finder"** (e.g., from Leslie Smith's work), where you start with a small learning rate, 
exponentially increase it until the loss diverges (overshoots), and then select a value slightly below that point. And this is interesting as well amazing cause the **"learning rate finder"** 
kind of works like linear search. 🔍

### **So with this done I asked Grok to write the step by step algorithm for this **dynamic learning rate** and the following is what it gave me.** 🧑‍💻
### Step-by-Step Algorithm for Your Dynamic Learning Rate Idea 🛠️
Now, building on your overall idea from our conversation (using overshooting/undershooting detection for dynamic adjustments) and incorporating the binary search repurposing you described, 
here's a simple, step-by-step algorithm in plain language. This is a high-level pseudocode-like outline you could implement in Python with a framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow. It focuses 
on a pre-training binary search to find an initial optimal learning rate, then applies dynamic adjustments during full training based on overshooting/undershooting signals. 🧩

#### Phase 1: Binary Search to Find Initial Learning Rate 🔍
This phase repurposes binary search to narrow down a good starting learning rate by testing for overshooting (loss diverges or oscillates) and undershooting (loss decreases too slowly or 
plateaus high). 📈📉

1. **Set initial bounds**: Choose a low starting learning rate (e.g., 1e-6, known to undershoot) and a high one (e.g., 1e-1, likely to overshoot). These are your "low" and "high" pointers. 🎯

2. **Test the high bound**: Train the model for a short run (e.g., 1-5 epochs on a small data subset) using the high learning rate. Monitor the loss:
   - If loss increases, oscillates wildly, or diverges, confirm it overshoots. Proceed. ⚠️
   - If not (e.g., it converges well), increase the high bound further and retest until you find one that overshoots. 🔍

3. **Calculate midpoint**: Set the test learning rate to the middle value: mid = (low + high) / 2. 🧮

4. **Run a short training test**: Train briefly with the mid learning rate and check the behavior:
   - If it overshoots (loss spikes or oscillates), set this mid as the new high bound (since it's too aggressive). 📈
   - If it undershoots (loss decreases very slowly, stays high, or plateaus without much improvement), set this mid as the new low bound (since it's too conservative). 📉
   - If it's balanced (losses decreasing steadily and similarly), keep the current rate. ✅

5. **Repeat**: Recalculate the new mid based on updated low and high, and loop through steps 3-4 until the low and high are close enough (e.g., difference < 1e-4) or you've done a set number
6. of iterations (e.g., 10). The final mid is your initial optimal learning rate. 🔄

7. **Output the initial rate**: Use the best mid as your starting learning rate for full training. 🚀

#### Phase 2: Dynamic Adjustments During Full Training 🎛️
Once you have the initial rate, monitor and adjust dynamically based on overshooting/undershooting, tying back to your earlier idea of using these as signals. 📊

1. **Start training**: Begin full model training with the initial learning rate from Phase 1. 🏁

2. **Monitor at intervals**: After every epoch or fixed steps, evaluate training loss and validation loss:
   - Compute the rate of loss change (e.g., delta = current_loss - previous_loss). 📉
   - Check for overshooting: If validation loss increases while training loss decreases, or if loss oscillates (e.g., delta changes sign frequently), flag as overshooting. ⚠️
   - Check for undershooting: If both losses decrease very slowly (e.g., |delta| < threshold like 0.01 for several steps) or remain high (e.g., above a baseline), flag as undershooting. 😴

3. **Adjust learning rate**:
   - If overshooting: Decrease the learning rate (e.g., multiply by 0.5 or 0.1) to stabilize. ⬇️
   - If undershooting: Increase the learning rate (e.g., multiply by 1.5 or 2) to accelerate learning, but cap it below the high bound from Phase 1 to avoid divergence. ⬆️
   - If balanced (losses decreasing steadily and similarly), keep the current rate. ✅

4. **Apply safeguards**: Set min/max bounds (from Phase 1) to prevent extreme changes. If adjustments happen too often, pause them or decay the rate gradually over time. 🛡️

5. **Continue until convergence**: Repeat monitoring and adjustments until the model reaches a stopping criterion (e.g., validation loss plateaus or max epochs reached). 🏁


So there you have it my version of **Dynamic Learning Rate**. 🎉
